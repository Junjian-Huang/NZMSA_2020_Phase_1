Microsoft Student Accelerator New Zealand 2020 Phase 1
Welcome to the 2020 NZMSA Phase 1. Please make sure you have read through this README document before starting. We will continuously update this repository as we find typos or documentations that need clarification.

Don't know what Phase 1 is?
Come visit our website to understand what we do: Microsoft Student Accelerator New Zealand Website

We have created two learning pathways:
Full Stack Development Pathway (HTML, JavaScript, Database, API)
Front End Development - React Web App
Back End development - Database and API
DevOps - Azure Pipeline
Data Science Pathway (Statistics, Data Science and Machine Learning)
Dataset building - API Call and Web Scraping
Exploratory analysis - Python and R
Model building - Python and R
To pass phase 1, you must complete one of the following paths:

Frontend Path (React Web App & DevOps - Azure Pipeline)
Backend Path (Databases and API & DevOps - Azure Pipeline)
Full Stack Development Path (React Web App & Databases and API & DevOps - Azure Pipeline)
Data Science Path
If you choose the Full Stack Development Pathway, we strongly recommend you to complete the Full Stack Development Path, instead of the sub paths which are Frontend Path / Backend Path. Doing so will improve your understanding and make phase 2 significantly easier.
